Guided Project: Explore U.S.Births
------------------------------------

Read the CSV file "US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS.csv" into a string.
Split the string on the newline character ("\n").
Display the first 10 values in the resulting list.


-----------
Create a function named read_csv() that:
Takes a single, required argument, a string representing the file name of the CSV file.
Reads the file into a string, splits the string on the newline character ("\n"), and removes the header row. 
Assign this list to string_list and create an empty list named final_list.
Uses a for loop to:
Iterate over string_list,
Create an empty list named int_fields,
Splits each row on the comma delimiter (,) and assigns the resulting list to string_fields,
Converts each value in string_fields to an integer and appends to int_fields,
Appends int_fields to final_list.
Returns final_list.
Use the read_csv() function to read in the file "US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS.csv" and assign the result to cdc_list.
Display the first 10 rows of cdc_list to confirm it's a list of lists, containing only integer values, and no header row.

--------

Create a function named month_births() that:
Takes a single, required argument, a list of lists.
Creates an empty dictionary, births_per_month, to store the monthly totals.
Uses a for loop to:
Iterate over the list of lists,
Extract the value in the month and births columns,
If the month value already exists as a key in births_per_month, the births value is added to the existing value,
If the month value doesn't exist as a key in births_per_month, it's created and the associated value is the births value.
After the loop, return the births_per_month dictionary.
Use the month_births() function to calculate the monthly totals for the dataset and assign the result to cdc_month_births. 
Display the dictionary.

-------

Create a function named dow_births() that takes a single, required argument (a list of lists) and returns a dictionary 
containing the total number of births for each unique value of the day_of_week column.
Use the dow_births() function to return the day-of-week totals for the dataset and assign the result to cdc_day_births. Display the dictionary.

------
That's it for the guided steps. Here are some suggestions for next steps:

Write a function that can calculate the min and max values for any dictionary that's passed in.
Write a function that extracts the same values across years and calculates the differences between consecutive values 
to show if number of births is increasing or decreasing.
For example, how did the number of births on Saturday change each year between 1994 and 2003?
Find a way to combine the CDC data with the SSA data, which you can find here. Specifically, brainstorm ways to deal
 with the overlapping time periods in the datasets.
